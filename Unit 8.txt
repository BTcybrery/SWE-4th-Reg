2. Advantage	of	XML?
3. Explain	low	level	design?
4. Explain	how	to	identify a class?

Answer

1.False
2.True
3.False
4.False

Short answer

1. XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language designed for storing and transporting data.

Platform-independent: It can be used across different systems and platforms.

Extensible: Users can define their own tags.

Self-descriptive: The structure of the data is embedded within the data itself.

3.ow-level design (LLD) involves the detailed design of individual components or modules of a system. It includes the design of algorithms, data structures, and the interaction between different modules. LLD is more detailed than high-level design and focuses on the implementation aspects of the system.

4.To identify a class in domain modeling:

Analyze the problem domain: Identify the key entities and concepts.

Look for nouns: In the problem description, nouns often represent potential classes.

Define attributes and behaviors: Determine the properties (attributes) and actions (methods) associated with each class.
