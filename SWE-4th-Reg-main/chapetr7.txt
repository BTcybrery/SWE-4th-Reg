 short answers 

1. What is a Requirement?

A requirement is a statement that describes a desired feature or functionality of a software system. It's a detailed description of what the system must do how it should behave, and what constraints it must adhere to. Requirements can be:

• Functional-; Describing what the system should do 
(e.g. "The system must allow users to register an account.")
• Non-functional-; Describing qualities of the system 
(e.g. "The system must be available 24/7.")

2.Why is Writing Use Cases Iterative?

Writing use cases is iterative because it's 
a process of refinement and understanding. 

• Initial Discovery: You start with a high-level understanding of the system's purpose and begin outlining the major actions users will take.
• Refinement: As you flesh out use cases you might discover new actors, goals or scenarios that require adjustments to existing use cases or the creation of new ones.
• Collaboration: Stakeholders (users developers business analysts) provide feedback leading to further refinements and adjustments to ensure the use cases accurately reflect the system's intended functionality.

3. Explain Actor Goal and Scenario

• Actor: An actor is anything that interacts with the system. It could be a human user another system a hardware device, or even time (for scheduled events).
• Goal: An actor has a specific goal they want to achieve through interacting with the system. For example a user's goal might be to "order a product online."
• Scenario: A scenario describes a specific sequence of interactions between an actor and the system to achieve a goal. 
It's a step-by-step description of how the actor will use the system to achieve their desired outcome.

4. What are the Classifications of Objects Discovered via Textual Analysis?

Textual analysis is used to extract information about system requirements from documents, user stories, or other textual sources. Here are some common classifications of objects discovered:

• Nouns: These often represent potential entity objects (data elements, concepts) 
in the system. For example, "customer," "product," "order," and "address."
• Verbs: Verbs can indicate potential actions, events, or use cases. For example
 "register," "search," "order," and "ship."
• Adjectives and Adverbs: These can help refine and qualify 
the properties of objects and actions. 
For example, "active customer," "fast shipping," or "secure payment."

• Textual analysis is only one method for object discovery; additional techniques like brainstorming and interviews are also valuable.
• Not all nouns will necessarily represent entity objects; further analysis is needed to determine which ones are relevant to the system. 
• It's a collaborative process; the classifications should be reviewed and validated by stakeholders to ensure they accurately reflect the system's requirements.
